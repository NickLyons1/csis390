      <h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>
        <p>
          It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art.
          Here are some of my favorite movements and their impact:
          <dl>
            <dt>Impressionism</dt>
            <dd>Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate 
              depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.
            </dd>
            <dt>Abstract Expressionism</dt>
            <dd>
              This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a 
              significant impact on contemporary art's freedom of expression.
            </dd>
            <dt>Pop Art</dt>
            <dd>A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and 
              popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </p>
      
      <p>
        Best regards,<br>
        Prof. Alex Hartley
